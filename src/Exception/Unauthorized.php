/**
 * The request requires user authentication.
 * The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47)
 * containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
 * The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field
 * (section 14.8). If the request already included Authorization credentials,
 * then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for
 * those credentials.
 *
 * If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response,
 * and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once,
 * then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response,
 * since that entity might include relevant diagnostic information.
 *
 * HTTP access authentication is explained in
 * "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication".
 *
 * Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication
 * is possible but has failed or not yet been provided.
 *
 * The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing
 * a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access
 * authentication and Digest access authentication.
 *
 * Error code response for missing or invalid authentication token.
