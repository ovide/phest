/**
 * The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state
 * of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected
 * that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.
 * The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to recognize
 * the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough
 * information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however,
 * that might not be possible and is not required.
 *
 * Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request.
 * For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included
 * changes to a resource which conflict with those made by
 * an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
 * to indicate that it can't complete the request.
 * In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of
 * the differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response
 * Content-Type.
 *
 * Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the
 * request, such as an edit conflict.
 *
 * Whenever a resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request.
 * Duplicate entries and deleting root objects when cascade-delete
 * is not supported are a couple of examples.
