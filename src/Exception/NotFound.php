/**
 * The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI.
 * No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent.
 *
 * The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows,
 * through some internally configurable mechanism,
 * that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address.
 *
 * This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal
 * exactly why the request has been refused,
 * or when no other response is applicable.
 *
 * The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future.
 * Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
 *
 * Used when the requested resource is not found,
 * whether it doesn't exist or if there was a 401 or 403 that,
 * for security reasons, the service wants to mask.
